-Shouldn't it be installed globally? Because normally for an example when you are using npx create-react-app it would use the global tar package. Isn't it? –

-actually it uses what ever version create-react-app tells it to use. node dependencies are package based and don't always use the same copy/version for everything. Also test carefully after a major version upgrade like this. There can be breaking changes. –

-Installing the latest version of tar will ensure that using create-react-app does not throw any warning, but this doesn't mean that the issue is resolved. If you try to update your global packages (assuming create-react-app is installed globally) the same warning is thrown. It seems create-react-app depends on tar-pack@3.4.1 which depends on tar@^2.1.1 As, @wheredidtatnamecomefrom comments above, node dependencies are packaged based and don't always use the same version for everything. Also, tar-pack was last updated 5 years ago. –
